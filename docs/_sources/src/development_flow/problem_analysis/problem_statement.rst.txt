Problem Statement
=================

Add problem statement, or *that which seems to best describe* the ``item``, without having any consideration about what might solve the problem. The problem statement is a set of problem statements. Each set maps to a ``product feature``. The problem statement maps to a ``product`` that satisfies the problem statement.
