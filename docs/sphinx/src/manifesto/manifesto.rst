Main Flow
---------

The main flow is the sequential iteration of the states ``sleep``, ``morning-preparation``, :ref:`engage-flow <engage_flow>`, ``evening-preparation``.

.. _engage_flow:

Engage Flow
-----------

The ``engage-flow`` starts by ``envisioning`` what to engage with. This can be achieved by consulting with the `backlog network graph <https://www.duckduckgo.com>`_ (for **context**), the `backlog <https://github.com/orgs/lifespline/projects/2>`_ (for **details**) and the `schedule <https://www.duckduckgo.com>`_ (for **scheduled milestones**). Knowing what to engage with, proceed engaged in full focus. The occurring subtasks (0.8 of them) must be logged as samples ``lifespline/samples-*`` so that they can be practiced upon later. Keep track of the subtasks on the `ipad notes <https://www.duckduckgo.com>`_ (to prevent loss of **context**). When the task is finished, you must to through the states of ``envision``, ``structure``, ``reduce`` and ``schedule``*TODO*. When these states have been finished, one iteration has been completed, and the new ``engaged`` iteration can commence.
