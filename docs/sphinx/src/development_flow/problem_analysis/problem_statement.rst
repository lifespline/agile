Problem Statement
=================

The problem statement is *that which best describes* the ``item``, without taking into consideration what might help solving the problem. The problem statement can also be defined by a set of problem statements.

Each set maps to a ``product feature``. The problem statement maps to a ``product`` that satisfies the problem statement.
