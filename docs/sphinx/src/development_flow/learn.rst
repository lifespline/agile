=====
Learn
=====

The sections below show the ``lifespline/agile`` development flow step: Learn.

Learning is ``learning-by-example``, as opposed to ``learning-by-memorizing``, that is, every concept must be accompanied by a ``concrete-example`` that contains:

* a real-life application of the concept
* the understanding of the concept
* the motivation for the concept

As it becomes easier to develop the concept theoretically without explaining it in concrete terms, it is recommended to always try to boil it down to real-life applications.

There is no point in learning without ``learning-by-example``

Example
-------

There is no point in *learning* this:

   Redis Enterprise has clustering capabilities built in. With a Redis    cluster, portions of a database are shared throughout a set of servers.    Redis Enterprise cluster uses a shared-nothing approach — each server within a cluster is responsible only for its own set of data. Cluster management is performed at a different layer of the Redis cluster architecture. This means that requests can be served as quickly as they would be if the server weren’t running in a cluster. Redis Enterprise cluster is linearly scalable with a multi-tenant and symmetric architecture. Within a Redis cluster, a given server is referred to as a node. Each node can be a primary (master) or a secondary (replica) node.
